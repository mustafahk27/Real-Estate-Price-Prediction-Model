## Introduction

Predicting real estate prices is a complex task due to the numerous factors that influence property values. This notebook aims to provide a simple and effective approach to predicting real estate prices using a machine learning model. By leveraging historical real estate data, the model attempts to forecast future prices based on various features.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and engineering
- Implementation of a machine learning model
- Visualization of predicted vs actual prices
- Evaluation of model performance

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mustafahk27/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Model.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

```bash
cd Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Model
```

3. Ensure you have the `Real estate.csv` file in the repository directory. This file contains the historical real estate data used for the prediction model.

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "RealEstate Price Prediction Model.ipynb"
```

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the cells and observe the results.
